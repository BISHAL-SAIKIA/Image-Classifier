# Image-Classifier
This project involves building and deploying an image classification system trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 categories (such as airplane, car, dog, etc.). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained using TensorFlow/Keras to accurately classify these images
